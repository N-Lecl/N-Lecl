# Nicolas - Web and Python Developer

## About Me

Hi there! I'm Nicolas and I work remotely for Technology and Strategy in Strasbourg. I joined the company on September 5, 2022, under an apprenticeship contract as a Web Developer with OpenClassrooms.

During this first year, I have acquired and honed my web development skills, working on various projects that have allowed me to master technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and several web frameworks.

Satisfied with this enriching experience, I decided to continue my journey at Technology and Strategy. One year later, I renewed my contract for a second apprenticeship, this time as a Python Developer. This new training allows me to broaden my skill set and dive into the world of Python development, with applications ranging from web development to data analysis and automation.

I am enthusiastic about continuing this professional adventure and contributing to the innovative projects at Technology and Strategy.
